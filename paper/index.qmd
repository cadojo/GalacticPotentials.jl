  Galactic dynamics simulations often use scalar potential fields for 
  numerically integrating point masses within larger gravitational fields. The 
  gradient of the scalar field provides the equations of motion for a point 
  mass within the field. This paper introduces a new package to the Julia 
  Programming Language's General registry: `GalacticPotentials.jl`. Many scalar
  potential fields defined in popular galactic dynamics Python packages --- 
  `gala` and `galpy` --- are defined within `GalacticPotentials.jl` as 
  `ModelingToolkit.jl` types. Each scalar field provided by 
  `GalacticPotentials.jl` can be queried for its gradient, states, parameters,
  and corresponding `ODESystem` and `ODEProblem` types through 
  `ModelingToolkit.jl` functions.
